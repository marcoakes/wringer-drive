"""What DRIVE emits, and the one rule that keeps it honest.

SPEC_DRIVE_V0 §9 question 4, decided 2026-08-17: **the transport is the PM's
own coding agent.** They already have one — Marc's directive is that they
install Wringer by pasting a prompt into it — so building them a new surface
would answer a question nobody asked. A local web page is forbidden anyway
(B1's test names `http.server` among the banned dependencies).

So DRIVE emits **structured, verbatim text** and something else carries it:

- an agent driving `wringer-drive --emit json`, relaying and returning answers;
- or a person at a terminal, when nothing is driving.

**Both read the SAME objects in this module**, which is why they cannot drift
into two products with two vocabularies.

## The one rule

**The agent is a TRANSPORT, not a TRANSLATOR.**

Every PM-facing sentence here comes from `wringer_board.refusals.say` or
`wringer_board.interview.plan`, verbatim. Nothing in this package writes a
sentence about a criterion, a refusal or a gate, and nothing paraphrases one.
An agent that summarised would be a second surface deciding what the engine
said, which SPEC_BOARD ruling 1 forbids outright — and it is the failure this
whole programme keeps finding: two things describing one fact, drifting apart.

`test_every_sentence_drive_emits_came_from_the_board` checks it structurally,
so the rule survives somebody being in a hurry.

"""`wringer-drive` — one verb, prose in, a board out.

Two front doors onto the SAME steps (SPEC_DRIVE_V0 §9 q4):

- `--emit json`, for a coding agent to drive. One JSON object per line.
- the default, for a person at a terminal when nothing is driving.

Neither is a second implementation. Both render `wringer_drive.steps.Step`
objects whose text came from the engine or the board, which is the only reason
they cannot drift into two products with two vocabularies.

**There is no `--yes`.** The approval question is asked by this process, after
this process rendered the plan, and no flag or environment variable answers it
— and neither does text that was already on stdin before the question was
rendered. Stale input is drained, never read: a pre-piped `yes` is an approval
nobody gave, and a pasted answer's overflow is not an answer to the next
question.

"""Guards on what this package SAYS about itself, and on the ordering it ships.

`wringer-drive/tests/` had no doc guards at all until 2026-08-18, and on that
day this package's own README claimed steps 7 to 10 were not built while the
code drove all four of them, the core's roadmap listed the whole cycle as
queued, and a public README claimed an independent review the spec's own state
table denies. **One fact, three documents, three different answers.**

The two doc guards below are split the way `wringer-board`'s are: the
cross-repository half lives in the DEPENDENT repository and reaches back,
because this package imports `wringer` and the core does not import this. That
is the structural answer to the failure `wringer/docs/MANUAL_CHECKS.md:723-744`
recorded — a correction that landed in one repository and never crossed the
boundary to the other.

Neither guard keeps a list of what is built. The first reads the verbs this
package really drives; the second reads the core's README on disk.

    On 2026-08-18 a clean clone of this repository was installed into a fresh
    virtual environment to check that it could be, and it could not:

      Because wringer-board was not found in the package registry and
      wringer-drive==0.1.0 depends on wringer-board, we can conclude that
      wringer-drive==0.1.0 cannot be used.

    Neither sibling is on PyPI, so `pip install -e .` — the first command a
    stranger types — fails with a resolver error that says nothing about what
    to do. The README said nothing about installing anything.

    Derived from `pyproject.toml`, so a dependency added later drags the
    README with it: every declared dependency must be named in a runnable
    block here. It cannot check that PyPI lacks them (these tests send
    nothing over the network), and it does not need to — naming them is
    right either way.

    `tools/acp_model_agent.py` is the model-backed ACP worker that produced
    the measurements the PM-plan work rests on. It had three paths that
    returned an empty file list without a word — no JSON in the reply, no
    `files` key, and entries dropped for having no `path` — and downstream an
    empty list is indistinguishable from a worker that looked and found
    nothing to change, which is what `no_progress` means.

    So it carried the exact silent-emptiness class that this programme spent
    a window removing from the engine, in the harness used to measure it."""
